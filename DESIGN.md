## Current Design Audit

### What's Working Well

| Aspect                 | Notes                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token architecture** | OKLch color space with full semantic token set. Clean separation between raw values and theme aliases.     |
| **Component base**     | shadcn/ui New York style gives solid, accessible primitives.                                               |
| **Typography**         | Geist Sans loaded via `next/font` — excellent legibility at all sizes.                                     |
| **Theme system**       | `next-themes` with system default + `.dark` class override is the right approach.                          |
| **Progress UX**        | Unvisited kana cards use a `border-2 border-primary` highlight to guide learners to unexplored characters. |
| **Sidebar structure**  | Clear hierarchy — Getting Started → Study sections, progress badges are useful.                            |
| **Responsive layout**  | Dashboard layout with collapsible sidebar on mobile works well.                                            |

### Bugs Fixed (2026-03-29)

All 6 bugs were fixed while keeping the existing orange/amber color palette unchanged.

| #   | Issue                                                                  | Fix                                                                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `--destructive` in light mode was near-black (`oklch(0.1908...)`)      | Changed to `oklch(0.628 0.2577 22.85)` — actual red                                                           |
| 2   | `--ring` was blue (`oklch(0.5937 0.1673 253.063)`) in both themes      | Light: set to primary `oklch(0.6171 0.1375 39.0427)` · Dark: set to primary `oklch(0.6724 0.1308 38.7559)`    |
| 3   | `--sidebar-border` in dark mode was near-white (`oklch(0.9401 0 0)`)   | Changed to match regular dark border `oklch(0.3618 0.0101 106.8928)`                                          |
| 4   | `--sidebar-primary` in dark mode was neutral gray (`oklch(0.325 0 0)`) | Changed to dark primary `oklch(0.6724 0.1308 38.7559)` — restores orange "Nihongo Cards" title                |
| 5   | Card bg = page bg in light mode (both `oklch(0.9818...)`)              | `--card` changed to `oklch(1 0 0)` (pure white) · Dark card bumped to `oklch(0.3085...)` (popover level)      |
| 6   | Font stack not wired to Geist                                          | `@theme inline` `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` now lead with `var(--font-geist-sans)` / `var(--font-geist-mono)` |

## Design Goals

1. **Cultural resonance** — The visual language should feel intentionally Japanese, not just generic edu-tech.
2. **Focus over fun** — Target audience is adult/teen learners. Avoid childish styles (claymorphism, comic fonts). Lean toward clean, focused, and calm.
3. **Legibility first** — Japanese characters at small sizes need high contrast. No low-contrast gray-on-gray for kana.
4. **Dark mode parity** — Both themes should feel equally polished and intentional.
5. **Consistency** — All component states (hover, active, visited, unvisited) should follow the same token system.

## Current Token Snapshot (post bug-fixes)

The original orange/amber palette is retained. These are the corrected values in `globals.css`:

### Light Theme (`:root`) — changed tokens

| Token           | Before                         | After                          | Reason                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `--card`        | `oklch(0.9818 0.0054 95.0986)` | `oklch(1 0 0)`                 | Card now white, lifts off warm bg |
| `--destructive` | `oklch(0.1908 0.002 106.5859)` | `oklch(0.628 0.2577 22.85)`    | Actual red                        |
| `--ring`        | `oklch(0.5937 0.1673 253.063)` | `oklch(0.6171 0.1375 39.0427)` | Matches primary                   |

### Dark Theme (`.dark`) — changed tokens

| Token               | Before                          | After                           | Reason                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `--card`            | `oklch(0.2679 0.0036 106.6427)` | `oklch(0.3085 0.0035 106.6039)` | Card distinct from bg       |
| `--ring`            | `oklch(0.5937 0.1673 253.063)`  | `oklch(0.6724 0.1308 38.7559)`  | Matches dark primary        |
| `--sidebar-primary` | `oklch(0.325 0 0)`              | `oklch(0.6724 0.1308 38.7559)`  | Restores orange brand color |
| `--sidebar-border`  | `oklch(0.9401 0 0)`             | `oklch(0.3618 0.0101 106.8928)` | Dark border, not near-white |

### Font Stack — `@theme inline`

`--font-sans` and `--font-mono` in `@theme inline` now lead with `var(--font-geist-sans)` / `var(--font-geist-mono)`. The duplicate `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` declarations that existed in `:root` and `.dark` (which were shadowing `@theme inline` and preventing Geist from loading) were removed.

## Accessibility Notes

- Primary orange `oklch(0.6171 0.1375 39.0427)` on white card passes WCAG 4.5:1 ✓
- `--destructive` `oklch(0.628 0.2577 22.85)` on white passes 4.5:1 with white text ✓
- Primary orange on white card passes WCAG 4.5:1; unvisited card `border-2 border-primary` is clearly visible at all sizes

---

## Open Considerations

- **Typography**: Geist is now correctly wired and works well. No immediate changes needed.
- **Settings page**: Three sparse sections — could benefit from a card grouping layout in a future pass.
- **Future palette evolution**: The current orange/amber palette is intentional. If a change is ever revisited, Vermillion and Indigo were considered as alternatives.
